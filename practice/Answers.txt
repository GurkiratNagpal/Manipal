2."Pick runtime exception?....
A. Class cast exception 
B. File not found exception 
C. Nullpointer exception

ANSWER = A,C,D.

3."Given:
public interface A{public void m1();}
class B implements A{}
class C implements A {public void m1(){}}
class D implements A{public void m1(int x){}}
abstract class E implements A{}
abstract class F implements A{public void m1(){}}
abstract class G implements A{public void m1(int x){}}
What is the result?

ANSWER: TWO CLASSES DO NOT COMPILE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT IMPLEMENT A FULLY. THE CLASSES ARE B &D.

D.  A class can inherit from multiple abstract classes

===========================================================

Points to ponder:

* private access specifiers is used for varaiables and functions which can be accessed only within class

* default access specifier is used for variables and functions which can be used only within the same package ie package friendly

* protected access specifier is used for variables and fucntions which are package friendly and can be access by classes derived in other packages

* public access specifiers is used for  variables and functions which can be accessed by different  classes in different packages

*  new operator is used to create instance variables and these variables are released when the  instance is destroyed


*  Variables, methods, and classes can be made static using static keywords. 
   Static variables and methods are single copy maintained within the class which can be shared by all instances created from the class
   instances/objects cannot be made static***
   Static variables and methods are accessed using class name  with dot operator
   No instances or objects are needed to access them.


* java.lan is the defaulted package for all java classes

* overridden methods access should have the same definition
  the visibility of  access specifers(eg. protected to public ) can be increased.
  decreasing the visibility (eg. if defined as protected in the base class, we cannot change to private in derived classes) is a compilation error

  Access specifiers can be "public" for  overridden methods in different packages.
